# **Simon Game**
Welcome to my version of the Simon Game :grinning:

## How to use:
Clone the repository and install node.
That's all you need!

## How to play:
In each level, the game will tell you which button to push.

The tricky part is that it'll only show you the last button and, you should remember the pattern from level 1 up until the current level.
If you push those buttons in the right pattern, you will go to the next level and, the game will show you the next button that you need to remember.

## Example:

### level 1
- game: red
- you: red

### level 2
- game: blue
- you: red , blue

### level 3
- game: red
- you: red , blue , red

### level 4
- game: green
- you: red , blue , red , green

and so on ...

If you push a button in the wrong order, ***the game is over***.


See how far you can go!

What's your personal record?
You can comment the highest level you could reach.

Have fun playing!
